/**
 * This is an example of counting document field length in Lucene.
 * Unfortunately, by the time I created the tutorial, Lucene does not store document length in its index.
 * An acceptable but slow solution is that you calculate document length by yourself based on a document
 * vector. In case your dataset is static and relatively small (such as just about or less than a few
 * million documents), you can simply compute all documents' lengths after you've built an index and store
 * them in an external file (it takes just 4MB to store 1 million docs' lengths as integers). At running
 * time, you can load all the computed document lengths to avoid loading doc vector and computing length.
